# Julius' Obsidian Voult

Program download > [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

A place where I save notes about programming and stuff.

It contains links, information and code snippets that I want quickly to find if needed again.

It is easy to synchronise with different computers (work and home) via the "obsidian-git" plugin which easily syncs voult storing it in GitHub and uses with git commands from the Obsidian interface.
